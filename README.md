Amazon Feedback Prediction Project

Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model to analyze and classify Amazon customer feedback. The model processes and cleans the text data and uses machine learning techniques to predict whether feedback is positive or negative.
--------------------------------
Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Amazon customer feedback dataset, which includes customer reviews and their corresponding feedback (positive or negative).
--------------------------------
Project Structure

data : Contains the dataset (amazon_df.csv)
notebooks  : Jupyter notebooks used for exploration and experimentation
scripts   : Python scripts for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
README   : Project documentation
--------------------------------
Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing pipeline consists of the following steps:

Punctuation Removal:  Removes all punctuation from the text.
Stopwords Removal:  Removes common English stopwords.
Text Vectorization:    Converts the cleaned text into numerical features using 				               CountVectorizer.

--------------------------------
Model Training

The model used in this project is the MultinomialNB (Multinomial Naive Bayes) classifier. The model is trained on the preprocessed data and then evaluated on the test set.
--------------------------------
Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
Confusion Matrix
These metrics help in understanding the effectiveness of the model in predicting positive and negative feedback.
--------------------------------


Future Work

To further improve the model, consider the following enhancements:

Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like GridSearchCV to find the optimal parameters for the model.
Advanced Models: Experiment with more sophisticated models like LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, or deep learning models.
